1. What you planned on doing for this homework deadline

	As copied from previous assignment -- For the next deadline, I believe
	I had planned on having the dictonary class finished, and the test cases 
	run along with their results for submission. I would still like to maintain
	this as my plan, but would like to include having the brute force class 
	completed and have the test cases for both of the classes started but not 
	maybe completed as initially intended. 

2. What you actually accomplished for this deadline

	For this deadline, I have mostly accomplished what my intended plans were
	with the small exception of of my classes not being 100% functional. They
	both are runnable, but I'm still in the process of debugging them which is
	requiring me to have to work with each in different portions to see where 
	some of the errors are occurring. Additionally, I have made good progress
	on the user interface. I know this was not part of my intended plan but I 
	have come to realize that I need to start on it now rather than later 
	because it would be easier to incorporate everything at the same time since
	the user interface is intended to run the different classes and their methods.
	I have chosen to use the boost library program optopns and file system libraries
	to aid in the user interface and parsing command line input from a user. I also 
	feel as if I have organized my code much better and cleaned up a lot of the 
	other stuff that was not needed. I feel as if these last few weeks I have made
	really good progress on this project, and feel as if I'm very close to having
	a working program, that I will be able to modify to fit any other desires for 
	the program once the entire backbone of it is working. 

3. What you had planned for the next deadline

	For the next deadline, I had planned on having the project finished. I do not 
	have any reason to change this, and feel as if I am still on track to accomplish
	this goal.
