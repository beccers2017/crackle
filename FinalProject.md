#FinalProject

1. For this deadline, I had planned on having my project finished.

2. For this deadline, I pretty much accomplished what I had intended give or take some small things. I had hoped to have more time to physcially write out more test cases and utilize them on top of the testing I've been doing myself. I have sort of ran out of time to do so and while I have been testing my program myself, it has not been to the extent that I hoped. The only other things, I feel I have not accomplished were very small things that don't directly affect how the program works, but are things that might make the program feel better for a user. I had also really hoped to get it set up to run directly from command line but also keep a simple interface that a user could work with. I have been able to get the simple interface to work, however, the command line functionality is set up within my code but keeps not working correctly, so until that gets sorted out, this program does not run from command line as I had hoped it would.

3. Not applicable since this is the last deadline. I do plan to continue working on this project even though it's officially done for class, and would eventually like to get it running as I want it to be and get to practice more with running tests.

4. Refer to screenshot folder to see images of the program.
