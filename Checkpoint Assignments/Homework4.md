1. What you planned on doing for this homework deadline

	As copied from previous assignment -- The plans for the next deadline is to have my brute-force attack class implemented, and have test cases started on it. Additionally, any thing I have started for the dictionary attack class. I think as of right now, I plan on reversing the order of these classes, meaning I will turn in the dictionary attack class implementation at the next deadline, and have test cases started on it, and submit anything I have started on the brute force attack class.  

2. What you actually accomplished for this deadline
	Note any differences and explain why they occurred
	
	For this deadline, I have not accomplished as much as I hoped. School has been very busy these last few weeks which has placed a huge limit on as much time I have had to put into this project. I also have been struggling a bit with wrapping my mind around how the entire brute force class neds to work. I', having difficulties with understanding the algorithm for it, however, I have made some progress in the last few days in my understanding of it and have started to write the code for this class. I've also had to spend time reading some of the documentation for the libraries I plan on utilizing such as the boost chrono, MPI, log library, OpenMP and the crypto libraries which is a new thing for me. I have had little experience with utilizing libraries such as these and it has exposed me to some parts of C++ that I am less familar with hence part of where this process has taken longer than I had anticipated. At this point, most of what I have accomplished is not very visible when it comes to my program as a lot of my time spent has been learning on how to use the libraries mentioned above. Having finished reading through the materials I needed too, I feel in a much better position to begin writing the code for my program than I had initially. I have added some code to both the BruteForce class and the Dictionary class or added some of the psuedocode for the functions I do plan on using. 
	
	
3. What you had planned to do for the next deadline
	Any changes you would like to make for this plan for the next deadline and the reasoning behind each change
	
	For the next deadline, I believe I had planned on having the dictonary class finished, and the test cases run along with their results for submission. I would still like to maintain this as my plan, but would like to include having the brute force class completed and have the test cases for both of the classes started but not maybe completed as initially intended. I am finding it a bit hard to stay on the schedule I had intially written out as I had wrote it around the due dates, but these dates seems to have shifted a little bit which has thrown me off in my ability to stay with my outlined schedule but this is something I will need to adjust for a bit. 
	
	
4. Screenshots of where your app/program is currently at. Embed these into this readme document

	I don't have any screenshots of my program at this point in time as it is all code that doesn't run yet as a program. I do hope to have some screenshots within the next few days as I am feeling a bit better about my knowledge on the libraries I need to use and how I plan on writing the code and hope to get some of this written out and in the basic phases of running at which point I will be able add screenshots of the working program.
