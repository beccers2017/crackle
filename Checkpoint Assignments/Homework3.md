What you planned on doing for this homework deadline:  
As copy + pasted from proposal-  

Week of Oct. 7
Goal: Setup GitHub Repository; set up Travis CI; begin creation of wordlist, hash table(s); continue researching hashing algorithms	
Goal for the end of the week is to have the wordlist generated.

Week of Oct. 14  
Goal: Begin writing the brute-force attack class; begin implementation of brute-force attack	
Turning in: The files containing the wordlists, and any functions written or used to create them. Any other parts of program started.  
Due on Oct.17  

What you actually accomplished for this deadline:  
For this deadline, I have accomplished the goals I had intended to accomplish. The only difference in what I had planned is the earlier start of the dictionary attack and the user interface, purely because I was having a hard time deciding where to start with the brute force attack class so I thought starting somewhere else might help me to get started on this part.  

What you had planned to do for the next deadline:  
The plans for the next deadline is to have my brute-force attack class implemented, and have test cases started on it. Additionally, any thing I have started for the dictionary attack class. I think as of right now, I plan on reversing the order of these classes, meaning I will turn in the dictionary attack class implementation at the next deadline, and have test cases started on it, and submit anything I have started on the brute force attack class.  

Part 4:  
There currently is not a lot to screenshot of this program. At it's current point it is mostly the skeleton of a program with the beginning of all the various classes started, the slight beginnings of a user interface and the wordlist that has been created. This wordlist itself  was created from 5-6 different word lists online that I merged together and had to sort, and remove duplicates from which took a good amount of time as it originally was over 2,000,000 lines which is why there isn't much to show otherwise for the program. I have also had to spend a lot of time researching cryptographic hash functions, to understand how they work and how these attacks work on them. These  functions themselves are a bit complicated and the official documentation is a bit rough to read through so this has taken up a lot of time rather than just writing the program. This was expected at this point in time and accounted for on my planned schedule.
